### Project Overview

This project develops a credit scoring model for wallets interacting with the Aave V2 protocol, assigning scores between 0 and 1000. The aim is to assess wallet behavior based on on-chain activity, rewarding responsible financial actions and penalizing risky behavior. Since labeled creditworthiness data is unavailable, we use an unsupervised machine learning approach combining Isolation Forest for anomaly detection and K-Means clustering for score assignment.

### Feature Engineering

The process starts with feature engineering, extracting metrics that reflect financial behavior. These include the number and volume of deposits and repayments, borrowing activity, repayment-to-borrow ratios, liquidation frequency, number of unique assets used, and active time span. These features form the behavioral fingerprint of each wallet.

### Anomaly Detection

Anomaly detection is performed using Isolation Forest, which identifies the most unusual 10% of wallets. These wallets are considered high-risk and are assigned low credit scores in the range of 0 to 200, scaled based on their anomaly severity.

### Clustering and Score Assignment

The remaining non-anomalous wallets are clustered using K-Means into five behavioral groups. A synthetic "ideal profile" is created by maximizing desirable behaviors (like high repayments and long activity span) and minimizing undesirable ones (like high liquidation count). Each walletâ€™s similarity to this ideal profile is measured using standardized distance, and scores are assigned using a non-linear exponential decay function. This approach rewards wallets that are closer to the ideal with higher scores in the range of 200 to 1000.

### Conclusion

This hybrid scoring model offers a robust, data-driven way to evaluate DeFi wallets based solely on on-chain activity. By blending anomaly detection and clustering with behavior-based profiling, it enables fair and scalable credit assessment
