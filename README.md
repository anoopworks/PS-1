Develop a robust machine learning model that assigns a credit score between 0 and 1000 to each wallet, based solely on historical transaction behavior.


### What type of ML is this?
The credit score should reward responsible behaviors (e.g., consistent deposits, timely repayments) and penalize risky or exploitative behaviors (e.g., frequent liquidations, high borrowing without repayment). Since no ground-truth labels are provided, this is an unsupervised learning problem where we need to infer creditworthiness from patterns in the data
